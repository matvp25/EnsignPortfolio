            One of my favorite projects to build was a fully functional Blackjack game using Java&apos;s graphical user interface (GUI) tools.
            This project was both a fun challenge and a great way to deepen my understanding of event-driven programming and GUI design.
            Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game where players try to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
            My implementation offers a user-friendly interface where players can:

            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>Deal cards,</li>
              <li>Hit (draw additional cards),</li>
              <li>Stand (keep their current hand),</li>
              <li>See the dealer&apos;s actions,</li>
              <li>And get real-time feedback on wins, losses, or ties.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            To personalize the game, I modified the interface colors, fonts, and text using Java&apos;s Color and Font classes. It was my first time customizing a GUI, and I learned how small changes can greatly enhance usability.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than just a card game, this project gave me hands-on experience with:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>Class inheritance and encapsulation</li>
              <li>Java Swing-style interface control</li>
              <li>Game flow logic (turns, scoring, outcomes)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, this project was a fun and practical way to combine Java fundamentals with interactive design, and it helped solidify my understanding of how code and user experience come together in application development.

            Key features include:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>Password length validation: at least 8 characters.</li>
              <li>Uppercase character requirement: at least one uppercase letter.</li>
              <li>Special characters inclusion: !@#$%^&* etc.</li>
              <li>Username exclusion: password cannot contain username.</li>
              <li>Difference from old password: new password must differ.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are prompted repeatedly until all criteria are met, with detailed feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a development perspective, this was a great exercise in input validation, loops, conditional logic, and user feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project demonstrates my ability to build practical tools focused on security and usability.
